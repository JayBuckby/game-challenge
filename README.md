The idea of the game is to correctly match 8 pairs of cards on a 4x4 grid.

Set a running counter to; 0 to store player moves

If the player clicks on a plain card,
increment the counter by 1
then the card should turn around and show a symbol,

Then the player can select another card,
increment the counter by 1
the card should turn around and show a symbol,

If the pair of symbols on a card match,
then the cards are given a solid gold border to show they're correct,

if the pair of symbols on a card don't match,
then the cards will shake and then turn back around,

When all pairs of cards have been correctly matched,
then an alert will play and confetti will show on the page,

the option to play agin will show and then the "game board" will be reset
and the running counter will be set to 0.

the game board will be given random locations for the cards each game to give replayability.
